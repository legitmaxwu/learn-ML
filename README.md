# learn-ML
A roadmap of Max's journey picking up machine learning.

1. Take [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
   - Learn fundamentals of linear regression (value prediction), logistic regression (classification), neural networks, and unsupervised machine learning methods.
   - Improve relevant analytical skills (matrix multiplication for code vectorization especially)
     - (vectorization = replacing for loops with vector operations, speeding up code)
   - Gain some general insight on good practices for tackling machine learning problems.
